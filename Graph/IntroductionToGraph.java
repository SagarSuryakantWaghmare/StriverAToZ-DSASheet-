        // so there may be one direction or two direction
        // Cycles in a graph
        // we start from the node and end at that node then we called as the cycle in the graph.

        // Path:Contains a lot of nodes and each of them are reachable

        // Degrees in a graph:
        // No of edges go inside and outside is called as the "degree".

        // Total Degree of a Graph=2*e
        // Directed Graph->Indegree(node)
        // outDegree(node)

        // Indegree=>no of incoming edges are in node.
        // Outdegree=>no of outcoming edges are in node.

        // Connected Components

        // Single node is also a graph
        // so we always use the concept of the visited array

        // So vis[]=new int[n];
        // So for(int i=1 to 10 ){
        // if(!vis[i])
        // Traversal(i);

        // so the graph is like the 1 ,2 ,3 ,4
        // So next graph is 5,6,7
        // So next graph is 8,9
        // and the last is 10
